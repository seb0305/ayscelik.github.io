Cellular senescence is a process initiated by stimuli, such as DNA damage or expression of different oncogenes, which ultimately leads to the loss of cells ability to proliferate (Campisi & d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007). As a result of this process there are proteins that are either upregulated or downregulated inside the cell which can be graphically represented. From this information, the idea was to represent the names of those proteins according to different locations in the cell and to give information whether they are upregulated or downregulated.
